A home grown real-time object detection for embedded devices using YOLOv7

Requirements:

- 🐍️ Python 3.8
- 📦️ See requirements.txt, there are a lot.
- 📷️ It is recommend to [build OpenCV from source](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) for local testing (or just in general).  Use version 4.7.0.68.
