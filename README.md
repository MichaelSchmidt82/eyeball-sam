# real-time-yolo-lite
A home grown real-time object detection for embedded devices using YOLOv7

Requirements:

- 🐍️ Python 3.7
- 📦️ See requirements.txt, there are a lot.
- 📷️ It is recommend to [build OpenCV from source](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) for local testing (or just in general).
- 🌊️ [Google coral](https://coral.ai/).  Check out Google's USB and installable M.2 modules.  They allow low power devices to operate in real-time.  You kinda need this.
